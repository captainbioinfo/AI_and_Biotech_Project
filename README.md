# AI_and_Biotech_Project

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is characterised by extensive transcriptomic dysregulation that can be effectively profiled using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). This project integrates RNA-seq data processing, differential gene expression analysis, functional enrichment, and machine-learning classification to identify biomarker genes capable of distinguishing colorectal tumor tissues from matched normal samples. Using the publicly available **GSE156451** dataset, this project establishes a reproducible workflow for precision oncology research and biomarker discovery.
