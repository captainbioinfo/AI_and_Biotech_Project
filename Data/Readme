# Reference Genome

For alignment, the analysis was performed on UseGalaxy.eu using the built-in reference genome:
Human Dec. 2013 (GRCh38/hg38).

For comparison, UseGalaxy.org provides an equivalent reference genome labeled as:
Human (Homo sapiens) (b38): hg38.
Although this genome was not used in the workflow, an inquiry between the two confirmed that both references are ~99.9% identical, with only minor variations that do not impact the downstream analysis performed here.

# Gene Annotation

For the read-counting step, an external Annotation GTF file (uploaded from the project’s shared Drive folder-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQoE4uxA5Ks6m5s2HK8lxA2qhLvCpEEv/view?usp=drive_link) was used as the gene annotation reference. This file served as the basis for assigning aligned reads to genomic features during quantification.
